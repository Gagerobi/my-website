                <p class="paragraph">
                  <span style="color: red;">I am <strong>currently</strong> working at Amazon,</span> in FC LGB6 in California. I am currently attending a bootcamp through Correlation One in software develepment. I am very excited to get through this course and add onto the knowledge I have in the tech field. I have graduated from Riverside City College with an Associates of science Computer Programming. I'm somewhat experienced in the C++ programming language, but I am trying my best to dive into web development and start a career in this field. This web page is intended to update you on the progress I make and the work I acomplish!

                <h1>Blog</h1>
                <p class="paragraph">My journey to become a software developer so far has been exciting and very interesting. Let's go beck to the begining. I started going to <a href="https://www.rcc.edu/index.html">Riverside City College</a> the year after graduating high school. I was majoring in computer programming, specialized in C++. This degree included HTML, CSS, and JavaScript classes. All of these languages worked together to create a website. I enjoyed coding in C++, but seeing instant results on a webpage was very interesting to me. After graduating, I didn't persue any further, although I wish I did. Now, a few years later, I am attending the Correlation One software development bootcamp and I am more than excited to get back into HTML and see what we can do!</p>
